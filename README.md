# binding-site-definition
Macro files in combination with a shell script to employ YASARA-Model (and above)  for defining binding sites and residues in further molecular docking simulations

<p> The files in this repository use the ability of YANACONDA Macro (https://www.yasara.org/yanaconda.htm) to substitute the splitpdb mode in SPORES (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19453150/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882397/) and the bind mode in PLANTS docking software (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19125657/). The software SPORES and PLANTS are no longer available on the official Universit√§t Konstanz website. </p>

<p>We have developed macros files to replace the modules since we can access YASARA-Structure. In October 2023, YASARA Biosciences GmbH made YASARA-Model freely available for academic users, at least until January 2026 (https://www.yasara.org/modeldl.htm). YASARA-Model could make use of our in-house developed macro files. Thus, here they are; we make the macros and the shell scripts embedded with the macro files publicly available. </p>
